# webhook spammer

<h2 align="center">a really simple webhook spammer. Has basic anti-ratelimit blah blah blah.</h3>
<h4 align="center">this is made for a simple MultiTool i'm working on/use for myself</h3>
<br />
<h2 align="left">~ The bullshit it does ~</h3>

- `sends like 5 msg's a second`
- `has a txt that lets you put in your own custom messages`

# usage and that

[!] **if you wanna run by itself read the steps below!** [!]

- **1:** the custom messages you want go in the 'messages.txt'
- **2:** run the program and then just enter the webhook you wanna use for spam. it will give you a prompt on how many times/how much you wanna spam so just put whatever number i guess
- **3:** easy like that. Wait for it to do its thing.. that is all it does, i dont know why i wrote all this.

**(YOU NEED PYTHON & REQUESTS MODULE INSTALLED TO RUN THIS)**

**Have fun?** ðŸ¤¨
